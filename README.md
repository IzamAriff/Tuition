# Tuition Centres
This Java program is designed to manage a tuition center, which consists of various components like headmasters, tutors, and students. It creates a new center by taking inputs such as the name of the center, registration number, and year of service. The program assumes that one headmaster represents one center, and an array of centers under the Center class is just a collection of different centers.

The user can add multiple headmasters, each with a specific number of tutors, and each tutor with a specific number of students. To store this information, the program uses an ArrayList, and the details of each headmaster, tutor, and student are stored in objects of their respective classes. The program prompts the user to enter details for each headmaster, tutor, and student.

Once all the information has been entered, the program displays the details of the center, including the name, registration number, and year of service, along with the details of all the headmasters, tutors, and students.

In addition to managing the existing data, the program allows the user to add or delete information. If the user chooses to delete data, they must select whether to delete a headmaster, tutor, or student, followed by entering the index of the item they want to delete. On the other hand, if the user chooses to add data, they must select whether to add a headmaster, tutor, or student. Depending on the choice, the user may be asked to enter additional information, such as the index of the headmaster where they want to add a tutor.

Overall, this Java program is a useful tool for managing a tuition center efficiently and effectively.
